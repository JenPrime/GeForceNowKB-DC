# GeForceNowKB-DC
Gaming Keyboard and Discord Wrapper for Nvidia's GeForce Now Service

I know the code is buggy and messy, I'm still working on it.

# How-to
1. Open the .sln solution in the Project GeCord right-click the file 'GeCord.cs' View Code
3. on line 29 replace INSERTYOURCLIENTIDHERE with the client id discord gave you
4. Place discord's rpc dll in the debug folder as 'discord-rpc-w32.dll'
5. Build, it should work

# How-to use with Keyboard software
1. Launch the game in GeForce Now
2. add wrapper\jpgfn[the game's name].exe as a Game in the Gaming software
   for Logitech Gaming Software also select "Lock profile in while game is running"
   for anything else I haven't tested it
